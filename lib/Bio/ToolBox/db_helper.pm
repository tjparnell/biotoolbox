=head1 NAME

Bio::ToolBox::db_helper - helper interface to various database formats

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In most cases, this module does not need to be used directly. The 
methods available to L<Bio::ToolBox::Data> and L<Bio::ToolBox::Data::Feature> 
provide convenient access to the methods described here.

These are helper subroutines to work with relevant databases that can be 
accessed through BioPerl modules. These include the L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> 
relational database as well as L<Bio::DB::Fasta>, L<Bio::DB::Sam>, 
L<Bio::DB::HTS>, L<Bio::DB::BigWig>, L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet>, and 
L<Bio::DB::BigBed> databases. The primary functions 
included opening connections to these databases, verifying features found 
within the database, generating lists of features or genomic intervals for 
subsequent analysis, and collecting features and/or scores within regions 
of interest. Collected scores may be summarized using a variety of statistical 
methods.

When collecting scores or features, the data may hosted in a variety of 
formats and locations. These include:

=over 4

=item SeqFeature database

Genomic feature annotation, including genes, transcripts, exons, etc, 
may be stored in a L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> database. These 
databases are backed by either a relational database, including 
MySQL, PostGreSQL, or SQLite. Small GFF3 files may also be loaded in 
an in-memory database. These are typically loaded from GFF3 
files; see the adapter documentation for more information. Dataset 
scores, such as from microarray, may also be stored as the score 
value in the source GFF file. 

References to local, binary, indexed files may also be included as 
attributes to features stored in the database. This is legacy support 
from the L<GBrowse genome browser|http://gmod.org/gbrowse>, and should 
not be used in preference to other methods. Supported files include the 
legacy binary wig files (F<.wib>, see L<Bio::Graphics::Wiggle>) using the 
C<wigfile> attribute, or bigWig files using the C<wigfile> or C<bigwigfile> 
attribute. The attribute values must be full paths. 

=item BigWig files

BigWig files (F<.bw> and F<.bigwig>) are compressed, binary, indexed 
versions of text wig files and may be accessed either locally or remotely. 
They support extremely  fast score retrieval from any genomic location of 
any size without sacrificing resolution (spatial and numeric). See
L<bigWig description|http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html> for more information. 
BigWig files are supported by either the L<Bio::DB::Big> or the 
L<Bio::DB::BigWig> adapter, based on either L<libBigWig|https://github.com/dpryan79/libBigWig> 
or the L<UCSC|http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#source_downloads> libraries, 
respectively; see their respective documentation for more information.

=item Directory of BigWig files

A directory containing two or more BigWig files is assembled into a 
BigWigSet, allowing for metadata, such as strand, to be associated with 
BigWig files. Additional metadata beyond the filename may be included in 
text file F<metadata.txt> within the directory. See the 
L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet> adapter documentation for more information. When using  
L<Bio::DB::Big> adapters, BigWigSet support is natively supported by 
the BioToolBox package.

=item BigBed files

BigBed files are compressed, binary, indexed versions of text BED files. See
L<bigBed description|http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigBed.html> for more information.
Both local and remote files may be accessed. BigBed files are supported by 
either the L<Bio::DB::Big> or the L<Bio::DB::BigBed> adapter, based on either L<libBigWig|https://github.com/dpryan79/libBigWig> 
or the L<UCSC|http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#source_downloads> libraries, 
respectively; see their respective documentation for more information.

=item Bam files

Bam files (F<.bam>) are compressed, binary, indexed versions of the text SAM file, 
or sequence alignment map. They are used with next generation sequencing 
technologies. They support individual alignment retrieval as well as 
read depth coverage. Two different Bam file adapters are supported. 

The L<Bio::DB::HTS> adapter is an interface to the Bam (or Cram) file. 
This is based on the modern HTSlib C library (version E<gt>= 1.0), successor 
to the original samtools library. See L<http://samtools.github.io> for 
more information.

The L<Bio::DB::Sam> adapter is an older interface to the Bam alignment 
file. This is based on the samtools C library version E<lt>= 0.1.19. While 
this adapter is still supported, the above should be used for new installs.

=item Cram files

Cram files (F<.cram>) are similar to Bam files, but are much smaller due to 
only storing sequence differences for each alignment. As such, they require 
an indexed, reference fasta to regenerate the complete alignment. Cram files 
are only supported by the L<Bio::DB::HTS> adapter.

=item USeq files

USeq files (F<.useq>) are compressed, binary, indexed files that support 
multiple information types, including region intervals, BED type 
annotations, or wig type scores distributed across the genome. They 
support rapid, random access across the genome and are comparable to 
both BigWig and BigBed files. See L<http://useq.sourceforge.net/useqArchiveFormat.html> 
for more information. Files may only be local. These files are supported 
by the L<Bio::DB::USeq> adapter. 

=item Fasta files

Fasta files (F<.fa> or F<.fasta>) may be opened. Fasta files are indexed to 
rapidly and randomly fetch genomic sequence. Three different adapters are 
available for indexing the fasta file. 

The L<Bio::DB::HTS::Faidx> adapter is preferentially used, and requires a 
F<.fai> index file. 

The L<Bio::DB::Sam::Fai> adapter may alternatively used, and also requires a 
F<.fai> index file.

The older style L<Bio::DB::Fasta> adapter is much slower, but will index 
either a single genomic fasta file or a directory of individual chromosome 
or contig fasta files. 

Additionally, genomic sequence stored in a L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> 
annotation database may also be used.

=back

While the functions within this library may appear to be simply a rehashing of 
the methods and functions in L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> and other modules, they 
either provide a simpler function to often used database methodologies or are 
designed to work intimately with the BioToolBox data format file and data structures 
(see L<Bio::ToolBox::file_helper>). One key advantage to these functions is the ability
to work with datasets that are stranded (transcriptome data, for example).

Historically, this module was initially written to use L<Bio::DB::GFF> for 
database usage. It has since been re-written to use L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> 
database schema. Additional functionality has also been added for other databases 
and file formats. 

Complete usage and examples for the functions are provided below.

=head1 USAGE

Call the module at the beginning of your perl script and include the module 
names to export. None are exported by default.

  use Bio::ToolBox::db_helper qw(
	  get_new_feature_list 
	  get_db_feature
  );

This will export the indicated subroutine names into the current namespace. 
Their usage is detailed below. 

=head1 EXPORTED SUBROUTINES

=over 4

=item C<$BAM_ADAPTER> variable

=item C<$BIG_ADAPTER> variable

These variables control which Bam and bigWig/bigBed adapters are used
during execution in installations where both adapters are present. These
variables are not set initially; adapters are chosen automatically when an
adapter is requested during execution and modules are evaluated for loading. 

=item use_bam_adapter

=item use_big_adapter

These are convenience methods for explicitly setting and retrieving the 
C<$BAM_ADAPTER> and C<$BIG_ADAPTER> variables, respectively. 

Optionally pass the value to set. It will always return the value being used. 
Values include the following:

=over 4

=item Bam adapter

   * hts     Bio::DB::HTS (default if available)
   * sam     Bio::DB::Sam
   * none    no adapters allowed

=item Big adapter

   * big     Bio::DB::Big (default if available)
   * ucsc    Bio::DB::BigWig and Bio::DB::BigBed
   * none    no adapters allowed

=back

=item use_minimum_mapq

Pass an integer (0..255 inclusive) representing the minimum alignment
mapping quality to be counted in counting collection methods using a Bam
file. Alignments with a C<MAPQ> value below the indicated value are
skipped and not counted. Higher values indicate increased confidence
in mapping placement in the genome; 0 indicates no confidence (usually
multi-mapping). Default is 0.

NOTE: This only affects alignment counting methods (C<count>, C<ncount>,
and C<pcount>), not coverage methods, e.g. C<mean>.

This always return the current value (default 0).

=item open_db_connection

	my $db_name = 'cerevisiae';
	my $db = open_db_connection($db_name);
	
	my $file = '/path/to/file.bam';
	my $db = open_db_connection($file);
	
	# within a forked child process
	# reusing the same variable to simplify code
	# pass second true value to avoid cache
	$db = open_db_connection($file, 1); 

This is a simplified, generalized method that will open a connection to a 
database or indexed file using any one of a number of different 
BioPerl-style adapters. For local and remote files, the appropriate 
adapter is determined by the file extension. Relational database 
connection and authentication information is checked in a configuration 
file. Once identified, the appropriate Perl module adapter is loaded 
during run time automatically, saving the user from knowing in advance  
to C<use> the appropriate module in the script. 

Pass the name of a relational database or the path of the database file to 
the subroutine. The opened database object is returned. If it fails, then 
an error message should be generated and nothing is returned.

B<Important!> If you are forking your perl process, B<always> re-open your 
database objects in the child process, and pass a second true value 
to avoid using the cached database object. By default, opened databases are 
cached to improve efficiency, but this will be disastrous when crossing forks. 

=over 4

=item SeqFeature Store database

Provide the name of the relational database to open. Parameters for 
connecting to a relational database are stored in the BioToolBox 
configuration file, F<.biotoolbox.cfg>. These include database adaptors, 
user name, password, etc. Further information regarding the configuration 
file may be found in L<Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::config>.

For SQLite databases, provide the path to the F<.sqlite> or F<.db> file.

For in-memory databases, provide the path to the F<.gff> or F<.gff3> file. 
The larger the file, the more memory and processing time is consumed as 
the file is parsed into memory. This may be fine for small model organisms 
like yeast, but not for vertebrate annotation.  

=item Bam file database 

Provide the path to the F<.bam> file. This may be a local file, or a remote 
URL (generally supported by the adapter). If a local F<.bam.bai> index file 
is not present, it will automatically be built prior to opening; this may 
fail if the bam file is not sorted. Remote files are not indexed.

=item Cram file database

Provide the path to the local F<.cram> file. Currently, supplementary fasta 
files are not supported, so the Cram file header must point to a valid 
reference. Cram files will be indexed automatically if an index is not available.

=item BigWig file database

Provide the path to a local F<.bw> or F<.bigwig> file, or URL to a 
remote file. 

=item BigWigSet database

A local or remote directory of one or more BigWig files that can treated 
collectively as a database. A special text file may be included in the 
directory to assign metadata to each BigWig file, including attributes such 
as type, source, display name, strand, etc. See L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet> for 
more information on the formatting of the metadata file. If a metadata 
file is not included (it's not necessary), then the filenames are used 
as the name and type. Strand may be parsed from the filenames if the 
basename ends in F<.f> and F<.r>.

=item BigBed database

Provide the path to a local F<.bb> or F<.bigbed> file, or URL to a 
remote file. 

=item USeq database

Provide the path to a local F<.bb> or F<.bigbed> file, or URL to a 
remote file. 

=item Fasta database

Provide the path to a local fasta file for rapidly fetching genomic 
sequence. If the fasta file is not indexed, then it will be indexed 
automatically upon opening. 

=back

=item get_db_name

  my $name = get_db_name($db);

This method will attempt to get the name of an opened Database 
object if, for some reason, it's unknown, e.g. the user only provided an 
opened db object. This only works for some databases, at least those I've 
bothered to track down and find a usable API call to use.

=item get_dataset_list

	my $db_name = 'cerevisiae';
	my @types = get_dataset_list($db_name);

This method will retrieve a list of the available features stored in the 
database and returns an array of the features' types.

Pass either the name of the database or an established database object. 
Supported databases include both L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> and 
L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet> databases. 

For L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> databases, the type is represented as 
"C<type:source>", corresponding to the third and second GFF columns, 
respectively. The types are sorted alphabetically first by source, 
then by method.

For L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet> databases, the C<type>, C<primary_tag>, C<method>, 
or C<display_name> attribute may be used, in that respective order of 
availability. The list is sorted alphabetically.

=item verify_or_request_feature_types

	# verify a dataset, either file or database type
	my $db_name = 'cerevisiae';
	my $dataset = 'microaray_data';
	my @features = verify_or_request_feature_types(
		db      => $db_name,
		feature => $dataset,
	);
	unless (@features) {
		die " no valid feature provided!\n";
	}
	
	# select a list of features
	my $db_name = 'cerevisiae';
	my @types = (); # user not provided
	@types = verify_or_request_feature_types(
		db      => $db_name,
		feature => $types,
	);
	# user will be promoted to select from database list
	if (@types) {
		print "using types " . join(", ", @types);
	}
	else {
		die " no valid features selected!\n";
	}

This subroutine will process a list of feature types or data sources to be 
used for data or feature collection. There are two modes of action. If a 
list was provided, it will process and verify the list. If no list was 
provided, then the user will be prompted to select from a list of available 
feature types in the provided database.

The provided list may be a list of feature types or a list of single 
file data sources, including Bam, bigWig, or bigBed files. If the list 
includes feature types, they are verified as existing in the provided 
database. If the list includes file names, the local files are checked 
and the names prefixed with "C<file:>" for use downstream.

If no list was provided, then a list of available feature types in the 
provided database will be presented to the user, and the user prompted 
to make a selection. One or more types may be selected, and a single 
item may be enforced if requested. The response is filtered through 
the parse_list method from L<Bio::ToolBox::utility>, so a mix of single 
numbers or a range of numbers may be accepted. The responses are then 
validated.

Two types of databases are supported: L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> and 
L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet> databases. For SeqFeature Store databases, the 
type is comprised of "C<method:source>", corresponding to the third and 
second GFF columns. For BigWigSet databases, types correspond to either 
the C<type>, C<method>, C<primary_tag>, or C<display_name> attributes, 
in that order of availability. 

For feature types or files that pass validation, they are returned as a 
list. Types of files that do not pass validation are printed to C<STDOUT>. 

To use this subroutine, pass an array with the following keys 
and values. Not every key is required.

=over 4

=item db

The name of the database or a reference to an established BioPerl
database object. A L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> or
L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet> database are typically used. Only required when
no features are provided.

=item feature

Pass either a single dataset name as a scalar or an anonymous array
reference of a list of dataset names. These may have been provided as
a command line option and need to be verified. If nothing is passed,
then a list of possible datasets will be presented to the user to be
chosen.

=item prompt

Provide a phrase to be prompted to the user to help in selecting
datasets from the list. If none is provided, a generic prompt will be
used.

=item single

A Boolean value (1 or 0) indicating whether only a single dataset is
allowed when selecting datasets from a presented list. If true, only
one dataset choice is accepted. If false, one or more dataset choices
are allowed. Default is false.

=item limit

Optionally provide a word or regular expression that matches the
feature type (C<primary_tag> only; C<source_tag>, if present, is ignored).
For example, provide "geneE<verbar>mrna" to only present gene and mRNA
features to the user. This is only applicable when a user must select
from a database list. The default is to list all available feature
types.

=back

=item check_dataset_for_rpm_support($dataset, [$cpu])

This subroutine will check a dataset for RPM, or Reads Per Million mapped, 
support. Only two types of database files support this, Bam files and 
BigBed files. If the dataset is either one of these, or the name of a 
database feature which points to one of these files, then it will 
calculate the total number of mapped alignments (Bam file) or features 
(BigBed file). It will return this total number. If the dataset does 
not support RPM (because it is not a Bam or BigBed file, for example), 
then it will return undefined.

Pass this subroutine one or two values. The first is the name of the
dataset. Ideally it should be validated using
L<verify_or_request_feature_types> and have an appropriate prefix (file,
http, or ftp). For multi-threaded execution, optionally pass a second value
for the number of CPU cores to use to count Bam files. This will speed up
counting bam files considerably. The default is 2 for environments where
L<Parallel::ForkManager> is installed, or 1 where it is not.

The mapping quality of alignments may be filtered by setting a global
filter using L</use_minimum_mapq> function. Example:

   # count the total number of alignments
   my $dataset = '/path/to/file.bam';
   my $cpu = 4;
   use_minimum_mapq(13);
   my $total_count = check_dataset_for_rpm_support($dataset, $cpu);

=item get_new_feature_list

	my $Data = Bio::ToolBox::Data->new;
	my $db_name = 'cerevisiae';
	my %data = get_new_feature_list(
		data      => $Data,
		db        => $db_name,
		features  => 'genes',
	);

This subroutine will generate a new feature list collected from an annotation 
database, such as a L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> database. It will populate 
an empty L<Bio:ToolBox::Data> object data table with a list of the collected 
features. Columns include the Primary ID, Name, and feature Type. 

The subroutine is passed an array containing three required arguments. The keys 
include

=over 4

=item data

An empty L<Bio::ToolBox::Data> object. This is required.

=item db

The name of the database or a reference to an established database object. 
Currently, this must be a L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> database.
This is required.

=item features

A scalar value containing a name representing the feature type(s) of
feature(s) to collect. The type may be a C<primary_tag> or C<primary_tag:source_tag>.
It may be a single element or a comma-delimited list. This is required.

=item chrskip

Provide a regular-expression compatible string for skipping features from 
specific chromosomes, for example mitochondrial or unmapped contigs.

=back

Status messages, including the number of features found and kept, are always 
printed to C<STDOUT>. 

=item get_new_genome_list

	my $Data = Bio::ToolBox::Data->new();
	my $db_name = 'cerevisiae';
	my $window_size = 500;
	my $step_size = 250;
	my %data = get_new_genome_list(
		data      => $Data,
		db        => $db_name,
		win       => $window_size,
		step      => $step_size,
	);

This subroutine will generate a new list of genomic windows or intervals. 
The genome is split into intervals of a specified size with the specified 
step size.

The subroutine is passed an array containing the required arguments. 

=over 4

=item data

An empty L<Bio::ToolBox::Data> object. This is required.

=item db

The name of the database or a reference to an established database
object. Any BioPerl adapter, including those described in the L</DESCRIPTION>, 
are supported. Required. 

=item win

A scalar value containing an integer representing the size of the
window in basepairs. The default value is 500 bp.

=item step

A scalar value containing an integer representing the step size for
advancing the window across the genome. The default is the window size.

=item chrskip

=item skip

=item exclude

Provide a regular expression compatible string for excluding specific 
chromosomes or classes of chromosomes, such as the mitochondrial or 
unmapped contigs. 

=back

Status messages are printed to C<STDOUT>. 

=item get_db_feature

    my $db = open_db_connection('annotation.db');
    my $seqfeature = get_db_feature(
        db      => $db,
        type    => 'gene',
        name    => 'ABC1',
    );

This subroutine will retrieve a specific feature from a L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> 
database for subsequent analysis, manipulation, and/or score retrieval using the 
L</get_segment_score> methods. It relies upon unique information to pull out a 
single, unique feature.

Several attributes may be used to pull out the feature, including the feature's 
unique database primary ID, name andE<sol>or aliases, and GFF type (C<primary_tag> 
andE<sol>or C<source>). The L</get_new_feature_list> subroutine will generate a list 
of features with their unique identifiers. 

The C<primary_id> attribute is preferentially used as it provides the best 
performance. However, it is not always portable between databases or even a 
database re-load. In that case, the C<display_name> and C<type> are used to identify 
potential features. Note that the C<display_name> may not always be unique in the 
database. In this case, the addition of aliases may help. If all else fails, a new 
feature list should be generated. 

To get a feature, pass an array of arguments.

=over 4

=item db

The name of the L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> database or a reference
to an established database object. 

=item id

Provide the C<primary_id> tag. In the L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store>
database schema this is a (usually) non-portable, unique identifier
specific to a database. It provides the fastest lookup.

=item name

A scalar value representing the feature C<display_name>. Aliases may be
appended with semicolon delimiters. 

=item type

Provide the feature type, which is typically expressed as
C<primary_tag:source>. Alternatively, provide just the C<primary_tag> only.

=back

While it is possible to identify features with any two attributes 
(or possibly just name or ID), the best performance is obtained with 
all three together. The first SeqFeature object is returned if multiple 
are found.

=item get_segment_score

    my $score = get_segment_score(
    	$seqfeature->seq_id,    # chromosome
    	$seqfeature->start,     # start
    	$seqfeature->end,       # end
    	$seqfeature->strand,    # strand
    	'sense',                # strandedness
    	'mean',                 # method
    	0,                      # return type
    	$db,                    # database
    	'scores.bw'             # datasets
    );

Generic method for collecting score(s) from a database. This is the 
primary interface to all of the database handling packages, including 
Bam, bigWig, bigBed, and USeq files, as well as SeqFeature databases. 
By passing common parameters here, the appropriate database or file 
handling packages are loaded during run time and the appropriate 
methods are called. Essentially, this is where the magic happens.

Pass the method an array of nine (or more) parameters. The parameters 
are not keyed as a hash, and the order is explicit. However, see the 
L<Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::constants> module for named index positions. 
The order is as follows.

=over 4

=item * 0 Chromosome

String representing chromosome or sequence ID.

=item * 1 Start

Start coordinate (integer, 1-based)

=item * 2 Stop

Stop or end coordinate (integer, 1-based)

=item * 3 Strand

BioPerl style strand value, including -1, 0, and 1.

=item * 4 Strandedness

A string indicating strandedness: sense, antisense, all.

=item * 5 Method

A string representing the method of data collection. 

Current acceptable methods include mean, median, sum, min, max, 
stddev, count, ncount (named count), and pcount (precise count). 
See the individual db_helper sub classes for more details. Not all 
adapters support all methods.

=item * 6 Return type

An integer (0, 1, 2) representing the type of value to return.

A return type of 0 indicates a single score should be returned, 
calculated using the specified method. A return type of 1 is an 
array or array reference of all scores found. A return type of 2 
is a hash or hash reference of coordinate => score. 

=item * 7 Dataset database

This is either a L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> or a L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet> 
database containing multiple score dataset features. If your dataset 
does not contain multiple different feature types, pass C<undefined>.

Pass either a string containing the name of database (which will be opened) 
or an already opened database object. 

=item * 8 Dataset

This is the verified dataset from which the scores will be passed. The 
dataset should be verified using the L</verify_or_request_feature_types> 
subroutine. For indexed file datasets, e.g. F<.bam> or F<.bw> files, 
this will the verified local path or URL. For a database, this will be 
a database type, sucha as C<primary_tag> or C<primary_tag:source>. 
or the path to a data file, e.g. Bam, bigWig, bigBed, or USeq file. 

If multiple datasets are to be combined, simply append them to the 
array (index 9, 10, etc).

=back

The returned item is dependent on the value of the return type code.

=item calculate_score

    my $scores = get_segment_score($chr,$start,$stop,$strand,
    	'sense','ncount',1,undef,'file:/path/to/dataset.bam');
    my $score = calculate_score('ncount', $scores);

This subroutine will perform the math to calculate a single score 
from an array of values. Current acceptable methods include mean, 
median, sum, min, max, stddev, count, ncount, and pcount.

Pass the subroutine two items: the name of the mathematical method 
enumerated above, and an array reference of the values to work on.
A single score will be returned.

=item get_chromosome_list

	my $db = open_db_connection('cerevisiae');
	# get all chromosomes in the database
	my @chromosomes = get_chromosome_list($db);
	foreach (@chromosomes) {
		my $name = $_->[0];
		my $length = $_->[1];
		print "chromosome $name is $length bp\n";
	}

This subroutine will collect a list of chromosomes or reference sequences 
in a Bio::DB database and return the list along with their sizes in bp. 
Many BioPerl-based databases are supported, including 
L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store>, L<Bio::DB::Fasta>, L<Bio::DB::Sam>, 
L<Bio::DB::HTS>, L<Bio::DB::BigWig>, L<Bio::DB::BigWigSet>, 
L<Bio::DB::BigBed>, or any others that support the C<seq_ids> method. 
L<Bio::DB::Big> adapters for big files are also supported, though see note 
below. See the L</open_db_connection> subroutine for more information.

Pass the subroutine either the name of the database, the path to the 
database file, or an opened database object.

Optionally pass a second value, a regular expression compatible string 
for skipping specific chromosomes or chromosome classes, such as mitochondrial 
or unmapped contigs. The default is to return all chromosomes. 

The subroutine will return an array, with each element representing each 
chromosome or reference sequence in the database. Each element is an anonymous 
array of two elements, the chromosome name and length in bp.

B<NOTE>: L<Bio::DB::Big> databases for bigWig and bigBed files do 
not return chromosomes in the original order as the file, and are returned 
in a sorted manner that may not be the original order.

=item low_level_bam_coverage

	my $coverage = low_level_bam_coverage($sam, $tid, $start, $stop);

This is a convenience method for running the low level bam coverage method. 
Since both L<Bio::DB::Sam> and L<Bio::DB::HTS> bam file adapters are 
supported, and each has slight variation in the API syntax, this method helps 
to abstract the actual method and use the appropriate syntax depending on 
which adapter is loaded. It is best if the C<$sam> object was opened using the 
L</open_db_connection> method, or that C<$BAM_ADAPTER> is set.

B<NOTE> that this is the B<low level> coverage method based on the index object, 
and not the similarly named high level API method. Read the adapter 
documentation for proper usage.

=item low_level_bam_fetch

	my $success = low_level_bam_fetch($sam, $tid, $start, $stop, $callback, $data);

This is a convenience method for running the low level bam fetch method. 
Since both L<Bio::DB::Sam> and L<Bio::DB::HTS> bam file adapters are 
supported, and each has slight variation in the API syntax, this method helps 
to abstract the actual method and use the appropriate syntax depending on 
which adapter is loaded. It is best if the C<$sam> object was opened using the 
L</open_db_connection> method, or that C<$BAM_ADAPTER> is set.

B<NOTE> that this is the B<low level> fetch method based on the index object, 
and not the similarly named high level API method. Read the adapter 
documentation for proper usage.

=item get_genomic_sequence

	my $sequence = get_genomic_sequence($db, $chrom, $start, $stop);

This is a convenience wrapper function for fetching genomic sequence from 
three different supported fasta database adapters, which, of course, all 
have different APIs, including the L<Bio::DB::Fasta>, L<Bio::DB::HTS::Faidx>, 
and L<Bio::DB::Sam::Fai> adapters, as well as L<Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store> 
and possibly other BioPerl databases. 

Pass the opened database object, chromosome, start, and stop coordinates. This 
assumes BioPerl standard 1-base coordinates. Only the forward sequence is 
retrieved. The sequence is returned as a simple string.

=back

=head1 INTERNAL SUBROUTINES

These are not intended for normal general consumption but are documented here 
so that at least some of us know what is going on.

=over 4

=item _lookup_db_method

Internal method for determining which database adapter and method call 
should be used given a set of parameters. This result is cached for 
future data queries (likely hundreds or thousands of repeated calls). 
The method is stored in the global hash C<%DB_METHODS>;

Pass the parameter array reference from L</get_segment_score>. This 
should load the appropriate db_helper sub module during run time.

=item _load_helper_module

Subroutine to load and import a db_helper module during run time.
Sets the appropriate global variable if successful. 

=item _load_bam_helper_module

Subroutine to determine which Bam adapter db_helper module to load, 
either the older samtools-based adapter or the newer HTSlib-based adapter.
Uses the global and exportable variable C<$BAM_ADAPTER> to set a 
preference for which adapter to use. Use 'sam' or 'hts' or some 
string containing these names. Do B<NOT> change this variable after 
loading the helper module; it will not do what you think it will do.
If both are available and a preference is not set then the hts helper 
is the default.
