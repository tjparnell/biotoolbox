=head1 NAME

Bio::ToolBox::db_helper::hts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides support for binary bam alignment files to the 
L<Bio::ToolBox> package through the HTSlib C library. 

=head1 USAGE

The module requires L<Bio::DB::HTS> to be installed, which in turn 
requires the HTSlib version 1.x.

In general, this module should not be used directly. Use the methods 
available in L<Bio::ToolBox::db_helper> or <Bio::ToolBox::Data>.  

All subroutines are exported by default.

=head2 Available subroutines

All subroutines are exported by default.

=over

=item open_bam_db

This subroutine will open a Bam database connection. Pass either the 
local path to a Bam file (F<.bam> extension) or the URL of a remote Bam 
file. A remote bam file must be indexed. A local bam file may be 
automatically indexed upon opening if the user has write permissions 
in the parent directory. 

It will return the opened database object.

=item open_indexed_fasta

This will open an indexed fasta file using the L<Bio::DB::HTS::Faidx> 
module. It requires a F<.fai> file to built, and one should be 
automatically built if it is not present. This provides a very fast 
interface to fetch genomic sequences, but no other support is 
provided. Pass the path to an uncompressed genomic fasta file 
(multiple sequences in one file is supported, but separate chromosome 
sequence files are not). The fasta index object is returned.

=item check_bam_index

This subroutine will check whether a bam index file is present and, 
if not, generate one. The L<Bio::DB::HTS> module uses the samtools 
style index extension, F<.bam.bai>, as opposed to the Picard style 
extension, F<.bai>. If a F<.bai> index is present, it will copy the 
file as F<.bam.bai> index. Unfortunately, a F<.bai> index cannot be 
used directly.

This method is called automatically prior to opening a bam database. 

=item write_new_bam_file

This subroutine will open a new empty Bam file. Pass the name of the 
new file as the argument. It will return a L<Bio::DB::HTSfile> object to 
which you can write a header followed by alignments. Be sure you know 
what to do before using this method! 

=item collect_bam_scores

This subroutine will collect only the data values from a binary bam file 
for the specified database region. The positional information of the 
scores is not retained.

Collected data values may be restricted to strand by specifying the desired 
strandedness (sense, antisense, or all), 
depending on the method of data collection. Collecting scores, or basepair 
coverage of alignments over the region of interest, does not currently support 
stranded data collection (as of this writing). However, enumerating 
alignments (count method) and collecting alignment lengths do support 
stranded data collection. Alignments are checked to see whether their midpoint 
is within the search interval before counting or length collected. 

As of version 1.30, paired-end bam files are properly handled with regards 
to strand; Strand is determined by the orientation of the first mate. However, 
pairs are still counted as two alignments, not one. To avoid this, use the 
value_type of 'ncount' and count the number of unique alignment names. 
(Previous versions treated all paired-end alignments as single-end alignments, 
severely limiting usefulness.)

The subroutine is passed a parameter array reference. See 
L</"Data Collection Parameters Reference"> below for details.

The subroutine returns an array or array reference of the requested dataset 
values found within the region of interest. 

=item collect_bam_position_scores

This subroutine will collect the score values from a binary bam file 
for the specified database region keyed by position. 

The subroutine is passed a parameter array reference. See 
L</"Data Collection Parameters Reference"> below for details.

The subroutine returns a hash or hash reference of the defined dataset values 
found within the region of interest keyed by position. The feature midpoint 
is used as the key position. When multiple features are found at the same 
position, a simple mean (for length data methods) or sum 
(for count methods) is returned. The ncount value type is not supported 
with positioned scores.

=item sum_total_bam_alignments

This subroutine will sum the total number of mapped fragments 
in a bam file. Properly paired alignments are counted once, and
supplemental, secondary, and marked duplicate alignments are ignored.
Alignments may be filtered by mapping quality. Use the
L<Bio::ToolBox::db_helper> C<use_minimum_mapq()> function to set
the minimum allowed mapping quality.
 
Pass the subroutine one or optionally two arguments in the following order. 

=over 4

=item 1. Bam file path or object 

The name of the Bam file which should be counted. Alternatively, an 
opened L<Bio::DB::HTS> object may also be given. Required.

=item 2. Number of forks (integer)

Optionally pass the number of parallel processes to execute 
when counting alignments. Walking through a Bam file is 
time consuming but can be easily parallelized. The module 
L<Parallel::ForkManager> is required, and the default is a 
conservative two processes when it is installed.

=back
       
The subroutine will return the number of alignments.

=back

=head2 Data Collection Parameters Reference

The data collection subroutines are passed an array reference of parameters. 
The recommended  method for data collection is to use the
L<Bio::ToolBox::db_helper/get_segment_score> method. 

The parameters array reference includes these items:

=over 4

=item 1. chromosome

=item 1. start coordinate

=item 3. stop coordinate

=item 4. strand

Should be standard BioPerl representation: -1, 0, or 1.

=item 5. strandedness

A scalar value representing the desired strandedness of the data 
to be collected. Acceptable values include "sense", "antisense", 
or "all". Only those scores which match the indicated 
strandedness are collected.

=item 6. score method

Acceptable values include score, count, pcount, and ncount.

   * score returns the basepair coverage of alignments over the 
   region of interest
   
   * count returns the number of alignments that overlap the 
   search region. 
   
   * pcount, or precise count, returns the count of alignments 
   whose start and end fall within the region. 
   
   * ncount, or named count, returns an array of alignment read  
   names. Use this to avoid double-counting paired-end reads by 
   counting only unique names. Reads are taken if they overlap 
   the search region.

=item 7. Database object.

Not used here.

=item 8. Paths to bam file

Subsequent bam files may also be provided as additional list items.
Opened Bam file objects are cached.
