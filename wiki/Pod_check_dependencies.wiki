==NAME==
check_dependencies.pl

==SYNOPSIS==
check_dependencies.pl

==OPTIONS==
None

==DESCRIPTION==
This program will check for Perl module dependencies used by the biotoolbox  scripts. It will check for the installed version and the current version  in CPAN. For missing or out of date modules, it will offer to install them  through CPAN. Note that any dependencies may not be handled well, and you  may wish to decline and install manually through CPAN.

If your Perl modules are located in system-owned directories, you may need to  execute this script with root privilages. Or, if you prefer, check what is  missing with this program and then install manually with root privilages.

This will require that CPAN is properly configured (proxies, mirrors, etc.).
