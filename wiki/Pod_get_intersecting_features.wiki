==NAME==
get_intersecting_features.pl

A script to pull out overlapping features from the database.

==SYNOPSIS==
get_intersecting_features.pl `[`--options`]` <**filename>

{{{
  Options:
  --in <filename>
  --db <database>
  --feature <text>
  --start <integer>
  --stop <integer>
  --extend <integer>
  --ref [start | mid]
  --out <filename>
  --gz
  --version
  --help
}}}
==OPTIONS==
The command line flags and descriptions:

__--in <**filename>

__
  Specify an input file containing either a list of database features or  genomic coordinates for which to collect data. The file should be a  tab-delimited text file, one row per feature, with columns representing  feature identifiers, attributes, coordinates, and/or data values. The  first row should be column headers. Bed files are acceptable, as are  text files generated by other _*_!BioToolBox**_*_ scripts. Files may be  gzipped compressed.
__
  __
__--db <**database>

__
  Specify the name of a `Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store` annotation database  from which gene or feature annotation may be derived. A database is  required for generating new data files with features. This option may  skipped when using coordinate information from an input file (e.g. BED  file), or when using an existing input file with the database indicated  in the metadata. For more information about using annotation databases,  see <[https://code.google.com/p/biotoolbox/wiki/WorkingWithDatabases]>.
__
  __
__--feature <**text>

__
  Specify the name of the target features to search for in the database that  intersect with the list of reference features. The type may be a either a  GFF "type" or a "type:method" string. If not specifed, then the database  will be queried for potential GFF types and a list presented to the user to  select one.
__
  __
__--start <**integer>, --stop <**integer>

__
  Optionally specify the relative start and stop positions from the 5' end (or  start coordinate for non-stranded features) with which to restrict the region  when searching for target features. For example, specify "--start=-200  --stop=0" to restrict to the promoter region of genes. Both positions must  be specified. Default is to take the entire region of the reference feature.
__
  __
__--extend <**integer>

__
  Optionally specify the number of bp to extend the reference feature's region  on each side. Useful when you have small reference regions and you want to  include a larger search region.
__
  __
__--ref `[`start | mid`]`

__
  Indicate the reference point from which to calculate the distance between the  reference and target features. The same reference point is used for both  features. Valid options include "start" (or 5' end for stranded features) and  "mid" (for midpoint). Default is "start".
__
  __
__--out <**filename>

__
  Optionally specify a new filename. A standard tim data text file is written.  The default is to rewrite the input file.
__
  __
__--gz

__
  Specify whether the output file should (not) be compressed with gzip.
__
  __
__--version

__
  Print the version number.
__
  __
__--help

==DESCRIPTION==
This program will take a list of reference features and identify  target features which intersect them. The reference features  may be either named features (name and type) or genomic regions (chromosome,  start, stop). By default, the search region for each reference feature is the  entire feature, but may be restricted or expanded in size with appropriate  modifiers (--start, --stop, --extend). The target features are specifed as  specific types.

Several attributes of the found features are appended to the original input  file data. First, the number of  target features are reported. If more than one are found, the feature with  the most overlap with the reference feature is preferentially listed. The name,  type, and strand of the selected target feature is reported. Finally, the  distance from the reference feature to the target feature is reported. The  reference points for measuring the distance is by default the start or 5' end  of the features, or optionally the midpoints. Note that the distance  measurement is relative to the coordinates after adjustment with the --start,  --stop, and --extend options.

A standard tim data text file is written.
