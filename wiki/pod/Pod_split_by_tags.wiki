==NAME==
split_by_tags.pl

==SYNOPSIS==
split_by_tags.pl <**sequence.fastq> <**tag1> <**tag2> ...

==DESCRIPTION==
This program will split a single fastq file into multiple fastq files based on  a barcode tag at the 5' end of the sequence. Usually the barcode is two  nucleotides, plus a T for linker ligation, for example GGT or AAT. After  identifying the tag in the sequence, it is stripped from the sequeence. A  separate file is then written for each tag, with the output file name being the  basename appended with the tag sequence. Input files may be gzipped, and  output files will preserve compression status. Input files should have a  recognizable extension, e.g. .txt, .fa, .fq, .fastq.
