==NAME==
change_cluster_order.pl

A script to change the order of gene cluster groups in a file.

==SYNOPSIS==
change_cluster_order.pl `[`--options...`]` <**filename>

{{{
  Options:
  --in <filename>
  --out <basename>
  --order <numbers,range>
  --keep
  --version
  --help
}}}
==OPTIONS==
The command line flags and descriptions:

__--in <**filename>

__
  Specify either the input CDT or KGG file. The program assumes both  files exist with the same basename and either a .kgg or .cdt file  extension.
__
  __
__--out <**basename>

__
  Specify the output filename. By default it uses the base name of the  input file. An appropriate .kgg and .cdt extension will be added.
__
  __
__---order <**numbers,range>

__
  Optionally provide the new order of gene cluster groups. A comma  delimited list and/or range may be provided, without spaces. For  example, 1-3,0,4,5.
__
  __
__--keep

__
  Optionally keep the same cluster group numbers in the KGG file as  the original, just in the new order. The default is to renumber  the group numbers.
__
  __
__--version

__
  Print the version number.
__
  __
__--help

==DESCRIPTION==
This program will change the order of gene cluster groups in KGG and CDT files.  These files are generated by the Cluster algorithm and represent k-means  clusters of genes based on collected experimental data. The cluster groups  are defined in the KGG file, which is a simple text format with two columns,  the gene ID and the GROUP number. Sometimes, when comparing data between two   or more separate cluster analyses, it is useful to re-order the clusters such  that similar clusters are ranked in a similar order. This script will  accomplish that goal.

A KGG or CDT file is provided (both are required, but only one needs to be  provided as a command line argument). The current order of the clusters is  presented, and a new order is then requested. The new groups are re-labeled  with new identifiers, or the old group numbers may be retained if requested.

CDT files may be visualized using the Java Treeview program, found at  <[http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net]>.
